# Development Practices for Ops

This is the "Dev" part if DevOps. PSEs will need to be able to explain the types of development practices that are what make DevOps so powerful.

## Documentation

We don't really cover this too much to be honest

## Education

Not really covered in detail

## Other

- <https://learn.gitlab.com/version-control/ebook-scm-for-enterp>
- <https://learn.gitlab.com/version-control/branching-strategies>
- [This entire series of tutorials on Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)

It's likely that many people that we hire will already understand the benefits that applying development practices to ops will bring.
However especially for CSEs they might not have experience on what the world was like before.
So being able to educate people on "here are all the good ideas that DevOps has taken from software development" is a good idea so that they can articulate this to customers
