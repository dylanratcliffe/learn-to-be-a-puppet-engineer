# Git workflow using r10k

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2021.2/orchestrator_workflow.html>

## Education

This is not really covered. Dylan usually makes sure to cover it on the whiteboard though at the end of the class so that people understand what is possible and what they need to be considering.

## Other

Dylan has tried to get as much detail as possible down on this page for [r10k-based workflows](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/PS/Puppet+Workflows)
