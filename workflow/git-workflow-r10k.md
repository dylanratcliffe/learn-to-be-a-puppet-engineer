# Git workflow using r10k

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2021.2/orchestrator_workflow.html>

## Education

This is not really covered. Dylan usually makes sure to cover it on the whiteboard though at the end of the class so that people understand what is possible and what they need to be considering.

## Other

PSEs should have studied [this page](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/PS/Puppet+Workflows) and should be able to present it to GSWP and practitioner classes (or customers) in the form of a whiteboard session explaining what the different workflows could be and what might be the advantages and disadvantages of each.
