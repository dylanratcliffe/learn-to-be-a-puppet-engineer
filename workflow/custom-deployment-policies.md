## Education

Definitely not covered.

## Other

Here is an example if a custom deployment policy that was [created for HSBC](https://github.com/dylanratcliffe/puppet-deployment_signature)

I wouldn't say the above is a good example since the requirement is pretty dumb in the first place but it is an example of how we can creatively use this to essentially create product features that otherwise don't exist.

Would be good to get some homework something around this
