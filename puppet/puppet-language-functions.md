# Puppet Language functions

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_write_functions_in_puppet.html>

## Education

Puppet-language functions aren't covered at all in GSWP.

Functions are covered in general in Practitioner and puppet-language functions are mentioned, however only very briefly and there is no lab for them.

## Other

I think that we are probably missing something here.
Often just the fact that it's taught in training means that the PSE will naturally learn it themselves because they don't want to be teaching something that they don't understand.
However this one is covered over so quickly that I think there's a good chance they would miss it
