# The types and providers abstraction layer

The types and providers abstraction layer, also called Resource Abstraction Layer (RAL) is a powerful concept in Puppet that seems woefully underdocumented.

## Documentation

The only bit of documentation we have is on [`puppet-resource`](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/man/resource.html)

## Education

Not covered in GSWP.

Covered in practitioner, though not in enough detail to actually teach a PSE how it works.

## Other

We don't have any homework that covers writing types and providers and we absolutely should.
This should probably use the [resource API](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/about_the_resource_api.html)

Another option would be the Types and Providers book by Dan Body and Nan Liu
