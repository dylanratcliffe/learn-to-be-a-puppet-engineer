# Conditional logic

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_conditional.html>

## Education

From what I can tell there is nothing in GSWP that is dedicated to conditional logic at all.
Some of the labs include case statements for example but there aren't any slides to actually explain what these are.

The "Configuration data without hiera" contains examples of if statements but no actual explanation

There are a few other examples of conditional logic in Practitioner:

* Code defensively
* Use data types as matching expressions


## Other

I don't think we really teach this anywhere else
