# Puppet Faces

Puppet faces are a way to add third-party functionality to puppet.
We can imagine them like third-party plugins to git, where a tool named `git-foo` is put in the path, and then is accessible as `git foo`.

This then allows integration into our CLI, help, logging, etc, etcâ€¦

## Documentation

Where does the documentation live?

## Education

This is not covered in any of our official education material.

## Other

Do we teach it in any other way, homework, blog posts, for example?

We seem to have filled a lot of the niches and pushed them into puppet itself.
We've kind of settled on putting things that don't fit fully into puppet in their own *external* tools.
