# Custom Hiera backends

## Documentation

[Documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera_custom_backends.html) here is reasonably good.

## Education

Not covered

## Other

We have no way that we teach this, though since it can be written as a puppet-language or ruby function, it is somewhat covered by those topics and having actually done one before probably isn't a hard requirement as long as you have the underlying skills
