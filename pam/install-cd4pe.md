Not covered

## Other

It is somewhat covered in ["Basics Six: Workflow with CD4PE and Testing"](https://confluence.puppetlabs.com/display/PS/PS+Onboarding+and+Continuation+Training#PSOnboardingandContinuationTraining-BasicsSix:WorkflowwithCD4PEandTesting) however this piece of homework is well and truly overdue for a revamp. It also doesn't cover things like:

* Backup and restore
* HA architecture
* How DR works and how to configure it
