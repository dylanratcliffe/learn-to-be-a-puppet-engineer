# Puppet DB queries & PQL

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/puppetdb/latest/api/query/tutorial-pql.html>

## Education

Is this covered in any of our official education material?

## Other

No homework for this. Would be good to write some though, just giving people some tasks like "Go get this from the database" and then they have to work out how to write the PQL query
