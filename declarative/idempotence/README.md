## Documentation

Starting here, https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/puppet_overview.html#key_concepts_puppet-idempotency the canonical document (according to our Search) explaining this is: https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2019.2/understanding_idempotency.html

Note that it doesn't exist in the Puppet Open Source section or in the newer version of the PE documentation.
Or rather, it was folded into a different document: https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2021.2/managing_windows_nodes.html#understanding_idempotency which seems really confusing.

## Eductation

Not covered in GSWP.

In the Puppet Practitioner, it only looks like it's just a rehash of something people should already be familiar with.
