# The type, title and namevar of a resource

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/lang_resources.html>

## Education

As far as I can tell this isn't covered in any of the courses

## Other

This would be something good to covered explicitly in some homework or something. It's not super complex but can be confusing initially
