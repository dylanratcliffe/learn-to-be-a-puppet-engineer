# Style and Naming Conventions

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/style_guide.html>

## Education

This is kind of covered generally in the courses but I don't think there is anything specifically dedicated to it

## Other

The homework in "basics three" and "intermediate four" all include code review elements so will cover this quite well
