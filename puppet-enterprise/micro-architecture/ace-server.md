# ACE Server

## Documentation

It would apprear that ACE is essentially completely undocumented which is very annoying. The code can be found here: https://github.com/puppetlabs/ace

ACE is managed by [this profile](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-enterprise-modules/blob/main/modules/puppet_enterprise/manifests/profile/ace_server.pp)

Request for docs is here: https://tickets.puppetlabs.com/browse/DOCUMENT-1237

## Education

Definitely not covered.

## Other

TBH I don't even really know what ACE does properly so I have no clue what we need to know about it
