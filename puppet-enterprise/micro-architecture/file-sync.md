# PE Micro Architecture: File Sync

## Documentation

- [Developer Documentation](https://github.com/puppetlabs/pe-file-sync/tree/2019.8.x/documentation)
- [About File Sync](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2021.2/filesync_about.html)

## Education

Definitely not covered.

## Other

Not covered anywhere else that I know of.
For most purposes it's not required to know too much about it other than how to clear caches.
I would probably expect a principal to look into reading the developer docs though and understand all of the options for how exactly it works
