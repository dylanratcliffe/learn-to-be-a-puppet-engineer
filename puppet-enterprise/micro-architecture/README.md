# Puppet Enterprise: Micro Architecture

## Documentation

<https://puppet.com/docs/pe/2021.2/pe_architecture_overview.html>

## Education

The architecture at this level is definitely not covered in training.

## Other

Homework only covers this in a small amount of detail. In order for PSEs to know exactly how all of these components works they will need to do the following:

* Read the documentation on the software architecture
* Find the docs for the component and read them
* Find the API docs and understand how things communicate with it, what calls you can make, what data it can return etc.
* Build a server and look at what config files get deployed, what is in them? What can you configure? How do you configure them with Puppet?
* Think about how they could become overloaded and if they did, how you would scale them?
