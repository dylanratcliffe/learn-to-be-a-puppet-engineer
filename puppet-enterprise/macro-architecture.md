# Puppet Enterprise: Macro Architecture

By Macro architecture I mean, what are the servers called, how do they talk to each other, what do they do. This is at a machine level rather than a service-by-service level

## Documentation

- [Supported architectures](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/supported_architectures.html)
- [Puppet Enterprise Reference Architectures](https://puppet.com/resources/whitepaper/puppet-enterprise-reference-architectures/)
- <https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-peadm/blob/main/documentation/architectures.md>

## Education

None of the education material really covers the architectures in any useful way.
I would always recommend that PSEs set aside some time to draw this up on the whiteboard though.
Start with the simplest architecture, explain how we would add compilers to deal with load and what compilers are for.
The talk about HA and super large architectures if needed

## Other

Homework does require the building of larger infrastructures, including HA
