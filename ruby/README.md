# Ruby: Language Basics

Would be good to be able to find a super quick ruby course for regular PSEs just give them some idea of what they are looking at.
Senior PSEs could then do a more advanced course.

For now, here's a few links and books:

## No skills required

As an easy way to get into Ruby for people who have close to no programming experience, I always recommend X for Kids series of books.
In Ruby's case, I'd recommend [Ruby Wizardry](https://www.nostarch.com/rubywizardry)

## Some skills required

The Ruby Website itself has a section dedicated to exploring Ruby from the viewpoints of somebody who already knows *other* languages: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/

This can be very useful to people who already know a language or two, but not ruby.

## Deep Dive

For extremely advanced use, i used to recommend [Ruby Under a Microscope](http://patshaughnessy.net/ruby-under-a-microscope)

It has a chapter on "Metaprogramming", and one on "JRuby: Ruby on the JVM" both of which are very relevant to Ruby in Puppet, so i wouldn't dismiss it just based on its age (2013)
